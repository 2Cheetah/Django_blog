To create user profile and add profile picture it's needed to create profile model in users/models.py:
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # OneToOneField means that one user has one profile and vice versa. on_delete=models.CASCADE means that if user is deleted, then it's profile is deleted as well, but deleting profile doesn't lead to remove of user.
    image = models.ImageField(default='default.jpg', upload_to='profile_pics')

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.user.username} Profile'

---

To be able to view created profile in admin page it's needed to modify users/admin.py:
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Profile

admin.site.register(Profile)

---

To be able to store pictures and uploaded documents in other places (not to mess up uploads from different apps), it's needed to add to settings.py:
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

---

To add profile picture and other data to profile page, it's needed to modify users/profile.html:
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}
{% block content %}
  <div class="content-section">
    <div class="media">
      <img class="rounded-circle account-img" src="{{ user.profile.image.url }}">
      <div class="media-body">
        <h2 class="account-heading">{{ user.username }}</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">{{ user.email }}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endblock content %}

---

To be able to view pictures in profile page it's needed to modify urls.py according to django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/static-files/#serving-static-files-during-development). It's different in development and production.
!from django.conf import settings
!from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('register/', user_views.register, name='register'),
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='users/login.html'), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(template_name='users/logout.html'), name='logout'),
    path('profile/', user_views.profile, name='profile'),
    path('', include('blog.urls'))
]

!if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

---

To automatically add profile and profile picture to new user, it's needed to create users/signal.py:
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Profile


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)


@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def save_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()

---

It's needed to modify users/apps.py as well:
from django.apps import AppConfig


class UsersConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'users'

    def ready(self):
        import users.signals
