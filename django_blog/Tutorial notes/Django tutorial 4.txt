To create admin it's needed to run following command:
> python manage.py createsuperuser

But it will not work without created DB. To create one it's needed to execute following commands:
> python manage.py makemigrations <= it's needed to prepare all migrations to be implemented
> python manage.py migrate

Create a user through admin panel.
